//! # Locked Sector State
//!
//! The `Locked` state represents a sector whose capacity is fixed at creation and cannot be modified
//! by growth or shrink operations. This state is useful when a fixed memory layout is required,
//! ensuring that once a sector is created, its capacity remains constant.
//!
//! ## Unique Behavior
//!
//! - **Growth Operations:** The implementation of the [`Grow`] trait for the `Locked` state is a no-op.
//!   Any attempt to grow the sector is silently ignored.
//!
//! - **Shrink Operations:** Similarly, the implementation of the [`Shrink`] trait is a no-op,
//!   meaning that the sector will not attempt to reduce its capacity under any circumstances.
//!
//! All other operations (such as element access, insertion, and removal) behave as defined by their
//! respective traits and do not have unique documentation for the `Locked` state.
